blood bowl bug:
 it is possible to move one over other causing that they will be forever like that

 warmachine notes:
   cards:
   faction (maybe array for multifactions), stats: spd, str, mat, rat, def, arm, cmd, ctrl, base(as
 i want these maybe in inches: 30mm = 1.18, 40mm, 1.57, 50mm= 1.97, 120mm= 4.72)
   weapons, hitpoints or box or circle, abilities, img
   cost

   field:
   size should be 4f x 4f / 1200mm x 1200mm / 48 inch x 48 inch (gotta think some conversion,
   propably 48 x 48 boxes should be correct enough and would be easy to calculate by that)
   1 inch = 25.4mm
